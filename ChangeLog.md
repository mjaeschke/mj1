added comments on the actual html doc took out the span in the headder because it didnt really change anything making less work also spaced out the heading and paragraphs to create a more visable document as opposed to the clutterd one before. 
consolidated the style.css doc into 4 separate files allowing for an easier way to fin certain files style.css contains the header body footer and all the paragraph code 
style2 contains all the css code for the jumbotron called "hero" 
style3 contains all the code for the benefits block 
style4 contains code that creates the style management, online rep management, and social media marketing blocks in the webstie.
